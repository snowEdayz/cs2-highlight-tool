## How to Use These Guidelines

1. **Before writing code**: Read the relevant guideline for your package
2. **During code review**: Check against patterns documented here
3. **When adding a feature**: Follow the established patterns — match what the codebase *actually does*

## For AI Agents

When dispatched as `trellis-implement` or `trellis-check`, these spec files are auto-injected into your prompt via `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl`. Read them before writing code.
